# MERN-stack-app

 For this project I built a dynamic single-page application from the ground up, using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). I was also able to implement an authentication system through API's routes/controllers I built from scratch.

 For the deployment phase of the project, I utilized Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Allowing me to efficiently provision and manage the resources needed to host the application. As well as ensuring a scalable and maintainable infrastructure that could adapt to changing requirements.
